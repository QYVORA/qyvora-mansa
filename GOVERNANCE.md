# Governance

## Maintainers

The project is maintained by QYVORA. Maintainer contact for security issues
is provided in `SECURITY.md`.

## Decision process

- **Small fixes and docs:** reviewed and merged by a maintainer.
- **New features and API changes:** discussed in an issue first, then
  implemented in a PR.
- **Security-sensitive changes:** reviewed by a maintainer and referenced
  against `SECURITY.md` and the authorization model in `docs/`.

## Releases

- Semantic versioning per [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
- Releases are tagged from `main` after CI passes.
- `main` must remain buildable and green.

## Scope of authority

Maintainers may decline contributions that conflict with the project's
purpose (authorized wireless security assessment, no unmonitored wardriving,
no tooling intended for unauthorized network access) even if technically
sound. This is a deliberate boundary, not an error.

## Community

Participation is governed by [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Code
of conduct reports are handled by the maintainers documented there.
